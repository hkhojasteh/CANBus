module CANBus

/* Basic Model of Controller Area Network (CAN bus).
 * A Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is a vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers
 *      and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a host computer on subscriber bus.
 *      It is a message-based protocol, designed for multiplex electrical wiring within automobiles and other contexts.
 *      The devices that are connected by a CAN network are typically sensors, actuators, and other control devices.
 *
 *	Notes: Some ideas inspired by the  firewire, messaging, chord and farmer(ordering) examples.
 *
 * CAN is a multi-master serial bus standard for connecting Electronic Control Units [ECUs] also known as nodes.
 * Two or more nodes are required on the CAN network to communicate. Each node is able to send and receive me-
 * ssages, but not simultaneously. A message or Fr ame consists primarily of the ID (identifier), which represents the
 * priority of the message, and data bytes. The message is transmitted serially onto the bus and may be received
 * by all nodes.

/* CAN has four frame types:
 *      Data frame: a frame containing node data for transmission
 *      Remote frame: a frame requesting the transmission of a specific identifier
 *      Error frame: a frame transmitted by any node detecting an error
 *      Overload frame: a frame to inject a delay between data and/or remote frame
